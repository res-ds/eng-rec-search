    main_prompt: > 
      Censor the following issue by applying the following rules:
      - Objects should be called by what they are.
      - Censor any identifying details about personnel, turbines, equipment identifiers (e.g. T4), as well as site names.
      - Personnel name should be turned to their job title (E.G.: Asset Manager) or 'Individual' if not there. 
      - Think carefully about site names, they are usually capitalised. Replace site name with 'SITE'.
      - Turbine identifiers should be replaced with 'TURBINE/S'.
      - Replace turbine manufacturers (e.g. GE, Nordex, Siemens) with 'OEM'.
      - Remove turbine specific parameters like power output (e.g. 2 MW), rotor diameter (e.g. 120 m), hub hight (e.g. 200 meters).
      - Replace MITE with Performance Indicator
    symptoms_prompt: The problem that a performance engineer has identified.
    recommendation_prompt: The recommendation that the performance engineer has made to resolve the issue.
    resolution_prompt: The action that was taken to resolve the issue.
